Description: An implementation of the Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA). EGA is part of a new area called network psychometrics,
            that focuses on the estimation of undirected network models to psychological datasets. EGA estimates the number of
            dimensions or factors using graphical lasso and a weighted network community analysis. A bootstrap method for
            verifying the stability of the estimation is also available. The fit of the structure suggested by EGA can be
            verified using confirmatory factor analysis and a direct way to convert the EGA structure to CFA is also
            implemented. Documentation and examples are available.
